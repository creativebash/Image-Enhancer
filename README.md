creativebash and jorelix

Requirement: The web app should allow users to upload photos, apply a machine learning model to enhance the photos, and download the enhanced version.

To-Do:
1. Set up a basic web framework (e.g., Flask, fastapi, or Django) to handle HTTP requests.
2. Create an HTML form to allow users to upload photos.
3. Implement a backend function to receive the uploaded photo and preprocess it for the machine learning model.
4. Integrate a pre-trained machine learning model for photo enhancement (e.g., a deep learning model for image super-resolution or denoising).
5. Apply the model to the preprocessed photo and generate an enhanced version.
6. Provide a link or button for users to download the enhanced photo.
7. Test the web app thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
8. Deploy the web app to a server or cloud platform for public access.
